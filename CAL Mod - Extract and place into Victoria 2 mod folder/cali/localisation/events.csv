EVTDESC1311601; The Iron Mountian Mine, also known as the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain, is a mine near Redding in Northern California. It operated from 1879 to 1963, however, iron ore was found as early as 1860. At its peak production, it was the tenth largest copper production site in the world, sixth in the United States, and first in California. There were ten different mines throughout the site's 4,400 acres, which were a source of iron, copper, silver, gold, zinc and pyrite. To take advantage of this discovory, we should issue a homestead act for the region. We should allow immigrants to settle and create a community in this region to provide workers for the mine.;;;;;;;;;;;x;
