Victoria 2 mod - Expansion upon Frymonmon's "Empire of the Pacific" mod, found on the paradox fourm.

I'm increadably greatful for recieving Frymonmon's explicit permission to do whatever I'd like with his mod and AAR while making this mod. Thanks again!

Go read his AAR, its one of the best I've ever read, and was an inspiration for me to add more flavour to his mod
