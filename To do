Add new flags - If permission is given, use communist flag from reddit as standard communist flag, and add a desicion to adopt a simplified flag after vexicologists start complaning, make it optional if possible?

See GER country file for flag change info, maybe use this as the code example?

govt_flag = 
{
	government = hms_government
	flag = presidential_dictatorship
}

Make it something like 

  option = {
	  	name = "EVTOPTA#######"     # = event number     Name = Appease the Vexicologists
		  add_country_modifier = {
			  name = Apease the vexicoligysts
        govt_flag = {
	        government = republic
	        flag = default
		  }
	
	set_country_flag = CAL_Flag_Changed
	  }


  option = {
	  	name = "EVTOPTA#######"     # = different event number   Name = Ignore the Vexicologists
	  }
}

Then add a decision to revert the change, just simply reverse the code used gov = repub flag = repub or something, have a potential check for the country flag added in the flag change
