Replace Homestead act with pop growth in Eureka, Sacramento, San Fransisco, & Mariposa

Reduce cost of Eurika logging camps, 15k or 20k, 30k too expensive

Rename Socialist party, Ursine Workers Union? - Also change to anti military from pacafist

Add State Capitalism to conservatives? - Check other cons to see if this is unfair, not being able to build factories until after 1860 is boring

Increase unit name variety, add all states, important mountians, important cities, important people?

Research Californian history for more flavour events

Add new flags - If permission is given, use communist flag from reddit as standard communist flag, and add a desicion to adopt a simplified flag after vexicologists start complaning, make it optional if possible?

See GER country file for flag change info, maybe use this as the code example?

govt_flag = 
{
	government = hms_government
	flag = presidential_dictatorship
}

Make it something like 

  option = {
	  	name = "EVTOPTA#######"     # = event number     Name = Appease the Vexicologists
		  add_country_modifier = {
			  name = Apease the vexicoligysts
        govt_flag = {
	        government = republic
	        flag = default
		  }
	
	set_country_flag = CAL_Flag_Changed
	  }


  option = {
	  	name = "EVTOPTA#######"     # = different event number   Name = Ignore the Vexicologists
	  }
}

Then add a decision to revert the change, just simply reverse the code used gov = repub flag = repub or something, have a potential check for the country flag added in the flag change
